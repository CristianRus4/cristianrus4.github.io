			<h1>Auckland</h1>

			<p>Auckland is the city I have felt most part of. Maybe it's because of its kind people, maybe because their interculturality, maybe because it's located in the antipodes where I was born, maybe because it has more trees than concrete, maybe because it's sitting on 48 volcanoes... I don't know, it's the whole of everything that makes me love this place with all my strength. Hard to reflect how great Auckland is, but I'm going to try.</p>

			
			<p>This page contains photographs and other things related to Auckland that I have experienced and seems relevant to me. It's constantly updated with new material and they are usually large files, so I apologize (actually no) if I consume your data.</p>
