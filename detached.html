			<h1>Detached</h1>
			
			<p>I left Internet, I am detached and it is wonderful. My life now is free of:</p>

<ul>
			<li>Social networks</li>
			<li>Streaming and video services</li>
			<li>Music and podcasts</li>
			<li>Messaging apps</li>
			<li>Personal email</li>
			<li>Newspapers, blogs and newsletters</li>
			<li>Online stores and reviews</li>
			<li>Ads, algorithms and trackers</li>
			</ul>

			<p>I said bye to all information that comes in my life via Internet.</p>

<h2>Wait, what?</h2>
			<p>Internet has influenced in my life more than anything. I live for and thanks to the World Wide Web. It has allowed me to grow as a person and professionally to unimaginable levels. I love Internet, and at the same time I hate it with all my strength.</p>

			<p>For years I tried to leave it. Sometimes I have taken breaks of several weeks while on vacation. However, in the end, always I had to come back because <a href="https://cristianrus4.me/xataka">my work</a> is essentially online. There is a solution, in recent months I have been working on a project that allows me to split my professional life from my personal life a little bit better. And, with it, disconnect the personal part from the network.</p>

			<p>The main idea to achieve this is to understand that my life does not depend upon Internet. This means getting rid of all the content that comes from online platforms.</p>

			
			
			
			<h2>A one-way channel</h2>

			<p>With this said, I have not completely disappeared from Internet, rather I created a one-way channel. I want to go back to the cyberspace where I grew up, where I didn't desperately seek attention from others, where I didn't rely on anyone or anything to make day-to-day decisions. On that Internet I had my own space where I expressed myself without waiting for feedback or anything else in return.</p>


			<p>I still want to do it. That is why my website now becomes a personal, safe and comfortable space to be present online. On my website you can find for example the <a href="https://cristianrus4.me/books">books that I read</a>, photos about <a href="https://cristianrus4.me/auckland">the beautiful city</a> where I live, <a href="https://cristianrus4.me/attitude">what I think</a>,  ██████ ████, <a href="https://cristianrus4.me/obsessions">current obsessions</a> or <a href="https://cristianrus4.me/kit">what I use</a>.</p>

			<p>Additionally, I am doing an interesting experiment in which <a href="https://twitter.com/cristianrus4">I publish on Twitter</a> without being on Twitter. I have set up a system to post tweets via SMS. I don't even know if they are going to be published or not, even less how people interact with those tweets. They are personal tweets, from my real life and 100% free from the ephemeral trends of Twitter and Internet in general. The kind of tweets I was posting in 2007 when I wasn't craving for attention yet. I am really excited about this.</p>

<hr>
			<p>Internet is wonderful, don't get me wrong. I appreciate with all my heart what humanity has done thanks to it. I am just oversaturated and I want to enjoy the experiences and people that currently surround my life. This is a work in progress and, so far, being detached is beautiful.</p>

			<p>From –the always beautiful– Auckland, NZ, I wish you all the best, Internet stranger.</p>

			<p>Cristian,</p>
