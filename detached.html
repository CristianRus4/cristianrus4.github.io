			<h1>Detached</h1>

			<p>Internet is the technology that has most influenced my life. I live for and thanks to Internet. It has allowed me to grow as a person and professionally to unimaginable levels. I love Internet. And at the same time, I hate it with all my strength.</p>

			<p>For years I have tried to leave Internet. Sometimes I have taken breaks of several weeks while on vacation. However, in the end, I have always had to go back because my work is essentially online. But I have a solution, in recent months I have been working on a project that allows me to separate my professional life from my personal life a little better. And, with it, leave Internet with everything that is not professional.</p>

			<p>The main idea to achieve this is to understand that my life does not depend upon Internet. This means getting rid of all the content that comes from Internet platforms:</p>

			<ul>
			<li>Goodbye social networks</li>
			<li>Goodbye streaming and video services</li>
			<li>Goodbye music and podcasts</li>
			<li>Goodbye messaging apps</li>
			<li>Goodbye personal email</li>
			<li>Goodbye newspapers, blogs and newsletters</li>
			<li>Goodbye algorithms for recommendations</li>
			<li>Goodbye online stores and reviews</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Goodbye to all information that comes from Internet.</p>

			<p>I want to go back to the Internet that I grew up with, where I didn't desperately seek attention from others, where I didn't rely on others to make day-to-day decisions. On that Internet I had my own space where I offered content to others without waiting for feedback or other content in return.</p>

			<h2>A one-way channel</h2>

			<p>With this said, I have not completely disappeared from Internet, rather I have created a one-way channel. I am going to offer content to the community, but without any possibility of receiving feedback from it. For this, my website becomes a personal, safe and comfortable space to be present online. On my website you can see find for example the books that I read, photos about the beautiful city where I live, what I think,  ██████ ████ or what I use.</p>

			<p>Additionally, I am doing an interesting experiment in which I publish on Twitter without using Twitter. I have set up a system to post tweets via SMS. I don't even know if they are going to be published or not, even less what people think. They are personal tweets, from my real life and 100% free from the ephemeral trends of Twitter and Internet in general. The kind of tweets I was posting in 2007 when I wasn't craving for attention yet. And I love it.</p>

			<p>The internet is wonderful, don't get me wrong. I appreciate with all my heart what humanity has done thanks to it. I'm just oversaturated and I want to enjoy the experiences and people that currently surround my life. And, as far, it's a great experiment.</p>

			<p>From –the always beautiful– Auckland, NZ, I wish you all the best, Internet stranger.</p>

			<p>Cristian,</p>
