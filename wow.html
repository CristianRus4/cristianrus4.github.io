			<h1>Wow! ðŸ‘€</h1>

			<p>Wow! So you think that my life is interesting enough to stalk me. That's not true, but if you're already here take a look to what I'm doing right now. Here you can find my current obsessions, some interesting links and more surprises in the future. Enjoy responsibly.</p>

			<p>So right now I'm working in <a href="http://cristianrus4.me/xataka">Xataka</a> and studing a Master in Design in NZ. Please, <a href="http://cristianrus4.me/auckland">take a look</a> to the beautiful city where I live.</p>

			<p>You can follow me on <a href="http://cristianrus4.me/twitter">Twitter</a> for bad jokes but probably I'm not tweeting nothing currently because I'm busy solving <a href="http://cristianrus4.me/attitude">my life</a>. However, soon you will be able to follow me in â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ (set a reminder for a couple of weeks and come back to see if it's ready).</p>
		

			<p>I can recommend you some nice movies from <a href="http://cristianrus4.me/letterboxd">my Letterboxd profile</a> if you're interested. And in <a href="http://cristianrus4.me/pocket">my Pocket profile</a> you can find articles as well. If you need good books take a look to <a href="http://cristianrus4.me/books">what I read</a>. Finally, if you're nerd enough, take a look to <a href="http://cristianrus4.me/homescreen">my homescreens</a> over the years or <a href="http://cristianrus4.me/kit">my kit</a> of products and services that I currently use.</p>

			<p>For anything else, feel free to write me <a href="mailto:cristianrus@hey.com">an email</a>.</p>

			<p>Best,</p>
