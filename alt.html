<h1>CRISTIAN RUS â€“</h1>
		

<p><mark>if you're looking for the serious Cristian you can find it <a href="https://www.cristianrus4.me/en">here</a>, but i prefer this one. born in '94 and raised in the world wide web, all my life is here. i love Internet with all my strength... and i don't know how to escape it. currently living in (the always beautiful) New Zealand.</mark></p>
			

<h2>_graphic design is my passion</h2>

<p><mark>seriously. i have studied graphic design and i also have experience creating brands, websites and more digital content for different companies. just ask me if you're curious. anyway, i'm working currently <a href="https://www.cristianrus4.me/en">as a journalist</a> for a long time.</mark></p>
	    	
<h2>_we can be friends</h2>

<p><mark>stalk me, i'm always on <a href="https://twitter.com/CristianRus4">Twitter</a>. it's complicated to reach me on other social networks because <strike>everything else sucks</strike> only Twitter is the right social network. also you can send me <a href="mailto:cristianrus4@gmail.com">an email</a> like in the old days.</mark></p>

<p><mark>are you still interested in me? look at <a href="https://www.cristianrus4.me/libros">the books i've read</a> or <a href="https://www.cristianrus4.me/movies">the movies i've watched</a>. i don't know what else... i'm obsessed with a few things more, but i don't want to look like a freak. Internet has enough freaks.</mark></p>
